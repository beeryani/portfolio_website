git is the most widely used version control software. the keyword to focus here is `version control`. To understand this,

independence. Say, you show this to your teacher, and she asks you to add few points to make it a perfect answer for your final
term exams.
You have just created a version of your paragraph/answer. This is version control. An iterative process to build code/documentation in the case of git.
